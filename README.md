## Project decription

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can classify pictures of pigmented skin lesions into benign and melanoma. Skin cancer can grow rapidly, so it is important for a fast and accurate way to tell melanomas and benign growths apart to be developed. We plan to the use the HAM10000 dataset (link: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/DBW86T) in order to develop our model. This dataset will be downloaded from the Harvard Dataverse, and it includes 10015 dermatoscopic images. The dataset was published in 2018. As we develop the model, some we will adjust some parameters in order to optimize performance. Some parameters we will consider changing are: 

CNN architecture (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or custom) ,
Learning rate,
Optimizer (Adam, SGD, RMSprop),
Batch size,
Dropout rate,
Data augmentation methods (rotation, zoom, horizontal flip, etc.),
Image resolution (input size),
Num neurons,
Num of layers
